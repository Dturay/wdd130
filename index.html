        Hello! My name is David and I am An Aspiring Software Developer. I am a
        willing learner with a passion for technology, innovation and problem
        solving. Over the years I have had the opportunity to work and learn
        from both responding to and solving adults complaints, and helping
        children develop technological skills. In doing this, I discovered that
        I have strong passion for innovating, improving, and helping others.
